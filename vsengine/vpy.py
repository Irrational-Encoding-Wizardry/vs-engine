vsengine.vpy runs vpy-scripts for you.

    >>> script("/path/to/my/script").result()
    >>> code("print('Hello, World!')").result()

script() and code() will create a Script-object which allows
you to run the script and access its environment.

script() takes a path as the first argument while code() accepts
code (either compiled, parsed or as a string/bytes) and returns the Script-
object.

Both methods accept an optional second argument which can either be an
environment or a policy. If it's an environment, it will run the script
in that environment. If it's a policy, it will create a new environment and
store the environment within the environment-attribute of the Script-instance,
which you have to dispose manually.

Additional keyword arguments include inline, which defaults to true, will
run the script in a separate worker thread, when set to false. Another
keyword argument is chdir, which will change the current directory during
execution.

A Script object has the function run() which returns a future which will
reject with ExecutionFailed or with resolve with None.

A convenience function called execute() which will block
until the script has run.

A Script-instance is awaitable, in which it will await the completion of the
script.
